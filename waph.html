      <p>Lab 0 Repository: <a href="https://github.com/prathyusha-kudaka/waph-kudakasa/tree/main/labs/lab0">Lab 0 Repository Link</a></p>
        Overview: In Lab 0, I successfully deployed an Ubuntu 22.04 Virtual Machine on CECH Sandbox, installed necessary software, and 
        tested the Apache Web Server. Additionally, I cloned the course repository, created a private repository on GitHub, and completed 
        git exercises. The report, following Markdown format, includes relevant screenshots and detailed steps.

      <p>Lab 1 Repository: <a href="https://github.com/prathyusha-kudaka/waph-kudakasa/tree/main/labs/lab1">Lab 1 Repository Link</a> </p>
       Overview: From the lab I have gained the foundational knowledge in HTTP and other network protocols as well as web application 
       programming. I have learnt using the wireshark to know how HTTP protocols works, the messages, developing a PHP web application, creating
       C programs, GET and POST requests, and also using the tools like Telnet and curl. 
    
      <p>Lab 2 Repository: <a href="https://github.com/prathyusha-kudaka/waph-kudakasa/tree/main/labs/lab2">Lab 2 Repository Link</a></p>
       Overview: In the lab 2, I have created a new HTML file, and began developing the HTML code to display essential tags, headshot and a form.
       In the next task I developed inline code to generate current date, time upon a click and a log key. Next I have written code to display the 
       digital clock. I have written a code for the visibility of email ID upon clicking and later wrote a code to generate the analog clock. 
       After this task, in the next task, I have written code for the Ajax GET request to the echo.php program to display the Ajax request. Later 
       I have inserted the CSS styles to change the format and colors for the web page. In the next task I have used jQuery to send the Ajax requests 
       and finally in the WebAPI part, using the jQuery Ajax I have written code for programming joke API and later wrote a program to fetch the age 
       based on the input.
    
      <p>Hackathon 1 Repository: <a href="https://github.com/prathyusha-kudaka/waph-kudakasa/tree/main/Hackathons/Hackathon-1"></a></p>
       Overview: Here the Hackathon-1 involves the cross-site scripting (XSS) which has two task involved in it. The task 1 involves in 
       execution of seven-levels of XSS attacks on the URL mentioned in the hackathon. Each level should be hacked and it should be shown 
       in the mentioned URL that the level has been hacked. For each level the vulnerable source code is hacked with required changes made 
       in the code. In the Task-2 the implementation of of the input validation and XSS defences are done in the echo.php file and the currently 
       provide front-end prototype. In the Task-2 in order to erase the XSS attacks the sanatisation of the codes are done. The code revisions are 
       done on the GitHub.
